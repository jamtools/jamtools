# Jam Tools

Jam your socks off with this all-in-one music performance system to help you bring your improvisations and creations to the next level.

When playing music with others and using this program:

- Stay on the same page when changing musical ideas
- Play big chords with minimal effort
- Utilize several entrypoints of user interactivity to make the most out of every situation.
- Create your own light shows to interact with during performance
- Extend the system by adding your own modules

### Development

In order to develop on the project, first clone the project and run the following in the root of the repository:

```sh
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create builds for all platforms
npm run build

# Watch for file changes, and continuously build and run all platforms
npm run dev
```

Then navigate to http://localhost:1337 to access the UI. Note that this will spin up a Springboard app with all Jam Tools modules registered, including prototype features which are not in a finished state.
