# Springboard

Springboard is a "write once, run everywhere" (as opposed to "anywhere") cross-platform application framework based on React and JSON-RPC. The framework embraces TypeScript isomorphism as much as possible, with support for dependency injection for each deployment context, which allows the application to easily pivot how things work in the different environments.
