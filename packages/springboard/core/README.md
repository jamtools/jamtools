# Springboard

> "Because your codebase should only be feature-level code"

Springboard is a full-stack JavaScript framework built with ReactJS, Hono, JSON-RPC, and WebSockets. The framework focuses on realtime communication, and avoiding the [analysis paralysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis) of determining your data model before writing features.

Based on side effect imports, with an emphasis on dependency injection.
