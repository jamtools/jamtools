The framework behind Jam Tools applications consists of the following components:

Most of what's on this docs site does not pertain to MIDI applications specifically, as all of the generic application features are available for use in any application. Though the inception of these tools are to develop powerful multiplayer MIDI applications, so examples will typically include how to incorporate MIDI instruments for a given feature.
